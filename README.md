# WikiCARS
 
For those of us who grew up watching Star Trek, things like the internet and Wikipedia have brought us so much closer to experiencing the future. Wikipedia itself perfectly exmplifies what Star Trek stands for: freedom of information, exploration, and learning.

The goal of this project is to create a unique and immersive user interface that provides access to the vast information available on Wikipedia, styled in the iconic LCARS (Library Computer Access and Retrieval System) format from Star Trek. This project is intended for fans of the franchise as well as technology enthusiasts who appreciate retro-futuristic design.

This project is currently in its earliest stages. I am using the template from the [LCARS Website HTML Template](www.thelcars.com) as the LCARS interface.
